Visit parks during busy times is safer.

As analyzed in our [Timeseries Analysis on NYC Parks Events] section, we only have complete data from start of 
2013 up to only the end of year of 2018. 
Also not easy to join datasets

Future directions:
* Population / ethnicity
* Political events
* Interactive map based on event category
