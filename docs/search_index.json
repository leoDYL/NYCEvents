The city has many interesting public places to visit - New York City has more than 1,700 parks, playgrounds, and recreation facilities across the five boroughs. With the large number of public facilities, there are almost always fun events happening in the city everyday. We’re very fascinated by the different events hosted by different organizations and cultural groups here in NYC, and would like to explore several aspects about this topic. In particular, you can expect to learn the following from our analysis: What are the most active and diverse parks in the New York City? Do event organizers have preferences over parks and event types? What are some interesting facts of the events in the parks? Do they vary for different boroughs of the New York City? Are there any seasonality and trend patterns for the events in parks? Do they vary for different event categories? Is there any association between crimes in parks and events in parks that we can identify? We hope you’ll also enjoy our study and discover new favorite parks to visit and attend public events in them! "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 NYC Parks Events Data 2.2 NYC Parks Crimes Data", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data we use for this project consist of two datasets. NYC Parks Events data and NYC Parks Crimes data. NYC Parks Events dataset is acquired through the NYC OpenData api. The data is collected by the Department of Parks and Recreation of the City of New York. The NYC Parks Crime dataset is acquired through the NYC.gov api. The data is provided by the New York Police Department. You can use our prepared script at https://github.com/leoDYL/NYCEvents/blob/main/scripts/download_raw_data.R to download all the source raw data we used in this project. This script will create a data/raw_data directory under the project root (please run this scrip under the project root) and download all the source data files we used under this directory. 2.1 NYC Parks Events Data In the event listing datasets, which contains data from 2013 to 2019, we can take a look at the diversity of parks from the organizer, event category and time’s perspectives. Based on the number of events hosted at different time and organized by different organizers, we can study on the liveliness of the parks. Other than that, since the datasets include detailed time information for each event from year to minute, we can study the time patterns that are presented in the data. Below, we introduce each data file for the park events. NYC Parks Events Listing – Event Listing, which can be downloaded as a CSV file. (74.9k rows, 15 columns) This is the main file that contains a table where each row contains the basic information of an event, which includes the following: Table 2.1: Data Schema for Park Events Listing Table Column Name Data Type event_id Number title Text date Date &amp; Time start_time Text end_time Text location_description Text description Text snippet Text phone Text email Text cost_free Number cost_description Text must_see Number url Text notice Number NYC Parks Events Listing – Event Categories, which can be downloaded as a CSV file (270k rows, 2 columns) This table contains records to describe the category of events. There could be more categories associated with one event. Table 2.2: Data Schema for Park Events Category Table Column Name Data Type event_id Text name Text NYC Parks Events Listing – Event Locations, which can be downloaded as a CSV file (95.8k rows, 9 columns) This table contains the location information for events.

NYC Parks Crime Statistics This data source contains multiple data files for each quarter from 2014 to the third quarter of 2021. After preprocessing and concatenation, it contains 32312 rows and 13 columns Below is the schema of the dataset. The details of the processing is mentioned in Transformation of NYC Parks Crimes Data.

The first thing to do is merging all the park event information into one dataframe, since they are originally separated in for csv files. Fortunately, all event datasets contain an event id with which we can merge all for data files into one event dataframe. As for the park crime dataset, we unified the quarter column format simply concatenated all the data file for each quarter into one crime dataframe. 3.1 Transformation of NYC Park Events Data For each separate data tables in for NYC park events, the first thing we do after reading them is to change the column names into abbrevations for display purpose. Those short forms of column names are explained when we discuss the charts. Additionally, as discussed in Cost, Borough, Duration, and Time of Events, in order to get a cleaner mosaic pair chart for duration and start time arguments, we create bins to have fewer blocks in the chart. Similarly, in Timeseries Analysis, we created weekday bins to count the events and analyze the time patterns. After reading all event datafames (listing, category, organizer, location). We merge them by event id. Since there are a decent amount of missing data in the data tables, as discussed in Missing Values By Individual Tables, we have to discard some of the columns that have a great amount of missing data and are also irrelevant to our analysis. Also, as mentioned in NYC Parks Events Data, each event can have multiple organizers, locations and categories. After comparing the results in Using Full Outer Joins and Using Left Outer Joins, we chose the left outer joined dataset as our main event dataset. 3.2 Transformation of NYC Parks Crimes Data The transformation of NYC Parks Crimes data is more straightforward compared to the event data. We also changed the column names to their shortened forms. Since the original data is separated into different files by quarter of the year and hence do not include any time information, we need to manually add a column to show the quarter and year for each record. After that, the different quarterly dataframes are concatenated into one crime dataframe. 3.3 Transformation for interactive components In the interactive section, we created time series charts on category and organizers. In order to do that, we create two dataframes that contain the count of events for each category/organizer in each month from 2014 to 2018. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing Values By Individual Tables 4.2 Missing Values for Joined Data Table 4.3 Top Categories with Missing Organizer 4.4 Missing Values for Crimes in Parks", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing Values By Individual Tables We first analyze the missing values pattern for all of our tables individually. 4.1.1 Missing Values for Main Events Listing Table As shown in the graph below, the majority of the data points have missing fields. The most missed fields are location_description (LcDs) and cost_description (CsDs). Roughly 80% of the data points aremissing location description, and more than 75% are missing cost description. Almost 40% of the data are actually missing both. We also have a lot of Email (Em) and Phone (Ph) missings (around 25% and 20% respectively). Those fields are not useful for our further analysis. For the description fields, they are textual and semantic, which would be interesting subjects for analysis and learning. However, the complexity of such analysis is beyond this study. As for contact information like email and phone number, they are not very relevant to our analysis. The top three missing patterns are missing both LcDs and CsDs, missing LcDs only, and missing CsDs only. And the top 9 missing patterns are all involving some combination of LcDs, CsDs, Em and Ph. ## LcDs CsDs Em Ph Snp Ds Url EvtId Title Dt ST ET CsFr ## 60360 59790 22941 16896 310 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## MtSe Ntc ## 0 0 In the chart below, we dropped the fields that we do not need as mentioned above. As shown in the graph, almost all the data points are complete cases now. The few missing data in snippet (Snp), description (Ds) and url (Url) fields, which are also not really needed in our study. ## Snp Ds Url EvtId Title Dt ST ET CsFr MtSe Ntc ## 310 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4.1.2 Missing Values for Auxiliary Tables We also inspect the other auxiliary data tables that we are planning to use for our analysis. ## Org EvtId ## 1 0 As can be clearly seen from the missing data plots, the event category table itself does not have any missing data, and the event organizer table has very few missing organizer rows, more precisely, it only has 1 row of organizer missing. The event id (EvtId) appears to be a unique identifier for events, and is always present in all rows of all tables we analyze. As for the location data for the park events, as we can see from the chart below, there are decent amount of missing fields in the data set. Almost 50% of the data are missing Address (Addr), and unfortunately we have almost 40% of the data missing field is zip (Zip), which we were hoping to use to help us allocate the parks into smaller regions for further location-based studies. Then the only location information for us to perform fine-grained regionalization of the parks is the longitude (Long) and latitude (Lat) field pair, for which we fortunately have 0 missing data. But the complexity would be much higher. It is interesting that the data set has complete longitude and latitude records for the events while a lot of the data are missing the zip code data. With zip code being the apparent easier location data to acquire, we suspect that the longitude and latitude data are required for event registration so that it could be located on a map instantly. Analyzing the missing patterns by rows, the top pattern is actually “complete cases”, although for only about 15% of the dataset. The data records missing only zip code (Zip) or address (Addr) comes second and third, then followed by the pattern of data missing all of address, zip code, and accessibility information. ## Addr Accs Zip PkId Bo LcNm EvtId Lat Long ## 46061 42620 37826 12263 1479 2 0 0 0 After dropping “Addr”, “Accs”, “PkId”, “Zip” columns in the data set, we can have a closer look at the missing data percentage for Borough (Bo) and Location Name (LcNm). Location name is not a reliable source of information for location identification, since locations are sketchy and not rigidly defined. The missing data in the Borough (Bo) fields are minimal, which would not affect our coarse-grained location-based studies. ## Bo LcNm EvtId Lat Long ## 1479 2 0 0 0 How about the missing patterns when joining the individual additional information tables (categories, locations, and organizers) with the main events listing table? We will explore in the following section. 4.2 Missing Values for Joined Data Table Next, we analyze the missing value patterns when we join our main events listing table with the auxiliary tables. 4.2.1 Using Full Outer Joins As previously discussed, the location description (LcDs), cost description (CsDs), email (Em), phone (Ph), snippet (Snp), description (Ds), url (url) are not interesting variables for the purpose of our project, as most of them are free-form text data, thus we are dropping them in this section for analyzing the missing patterns for the events listing data joined with other additional information tables since we do not really care if they are missing or not. Also, as disccused previously, title (Title), is cost free (CsFr), date (Dt), end time (ET), is must see (MtSe), notice (Ntc), start time (ST) all have no missing data in the main events listing data table, we will only keep title (Title) to represent these variables in this section. As analyzed above, Lat / Long are always present in the locations table, thus we will use Lat to count the number of unique locations per EvtId, thus we used it to determine if location information is missing or not in the joined table. ## Title Org Cat Loc EvtId ## 19406 8784 2571 2010 0 When only looking at these variables, almost 75% of the rows have complete information. There are roughly 15% cases from the joined dataset that have all of the event_id, organizer, category, and location information, but missing the title (and thus the other variables information) only, meaning that there are close to 15% of the events with an event_id that appear in all of the auxiliary tables but not the main event listing table. Therefore, if we performed left outer joins on the tables (where we keep the main event listing table on the left), we should be getting close to 90% of complete cases. Also, roughly more than 20% of the cases are missing title, these are the events with event_id appear in at least one of the auxiliary tables but not in the main table. It is also interesting to see that there are no cases of all organizer, category, location information missing but with title information present. So any listed events in the main dataset have at least one of the three information (organizer, category, location). A potential explanation for the above facts might be that a placeholder event can be registered in the system with a minimum one of these three pieces of information and an event_id was generated, but the event may or may not ultimately get listed and stored in the main event listing table. 4.2.2 Using Left Outer Joins The following plot demonstrates the missing pattern analysis when we instead perform left joins of the main table with the auxiliary tables. It confirms that we have close to 90% (from the plots, more than 87.5%) of complete cases among these variables, and the top missing variable is organizer (less than 12.5%), followed by category, followed by location information. As a result of the analysis in this section, we will use the table produced by the left outer join (including the variables that were left out in this section due to the Title representation) for our main analysis in later chapters, since it includes the most complete and interesting information. 4.3 Top Categories with Missing Organizer It is still pretty surprising to us that after the left outer join, we still have more than 10% of the cases missing an organizer, as we thought all events should have an organizer. Therefore, we wanted to see what are the top categories of events without the organizer information. Note here that an event might be associated with multiple categories, so the total number of missing organizers across the different categories would be higher than the number of events with missing organizers in the previous section. So it seems that sports-related events (with Fitness/Running/Sports/Outdoor Fitness categories) are the most common themes for events missing organizer information in our dataset. A closer look at the specific event titles suggests that a lot of them were running events organized by “NYRR” in different parks: 4.4 Missing Values for Crimes in Parks ## Park Qtr Boro Size Cat Mdr Rape Rob Ass Burg G_L ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## GL_M_V Tot ## 0 0 The NYC park crime data originally comes in different files by quarter. We consolidated all of them to analyze the missing data pattern. In order to ensure that no parks are missed in any of the data files, we created a data set with all the &lt;park, quarter&gt; pairs there could possibly be in the crime data set. Then we merge the new data set with the crime data set to perform the missing data analysis. As shown in the graph above, there is actually no missing data in the crime data set. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Events and Parks Analysis 5.2 Timeseries Analysis 5.3 Crimes in Parks 5.4 Spatial Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Events and Parks Analysis 5.1.1 Most Diverse Park Since our main dataset is about the events in the different parks in NYC, very naturally, the first thing we’ll look at is what are some of the parks and locations with the most events: From this Cleveland Dot Plot of top 30 parks with the most number of events listed from 2013-2019 in our dataset, we can see that the top 2 locations are prety much outliers from the rest of the group, with “Poe Park Visitor Center” having more than 7000 events, followed by “Queens Botanical Garden”, with more than 3000 events, and the rest of the top 30 locations all have fewer than 2000 events over the years. After seeing that the top event locations are hosting several thousands of events over the years 2013-2019, we wonder which of them are the most diverse ones, in the sense that they have a lot of distinct event organizers organizing events of different categories in them. We have labeled the locations with more than 24 unique organizers who have hosted events, or have events of more than 45 different event categories over the years, as well as the locations with most events - \"“Poe Park Visitor Center” and “Queens Botanical Garden” - interesting enough that for these two, we can notice although they have a diverse number of event categories, they both had no more than 10 distinct organizers who have organized events in them. Surprisingly, the most famous parks like “Central Park” and “Washington Square Park” do not show up. From the location names, we realize these parks might be too large and have different sub locations (e.g. “Visitor Center” inside of “Conference House Park”) listed as the location name in the datasets we have. We then again plot the scatterplot using PkId: A quick Googling using the longitude and latitude of these park ids tells us that, the labels from left to right are: (#tab:Most Diverse Park mapping table)Park Id to Park Name Mapping for Diverse Parks Park Id Park Name X039 Pelham Bay Park B073 Prospect Park X104 Williamsbridge Oval Skate Park X092 Van Cortlandt Park X045 St. Mary’s Park M029 Fort Tryon Park R006 Conference House Park M098 Washington Square Park M042 Inwood Hill Park Q099 Flushing Meadows Corona Park M010 Central Park all of which are more well-known parks in NYC. From this scatter plot, it is certainly apparent that there seems to be a correlation that the parks with more diverse groups of organizers choosing them as event locations tend to have events with more diverse categories as well, which makes us wonder if different organizers have preferences over certain event categories, for which we will analyze in the next section. 5.1.2 Organizer Preferences on Categories and Locations We can use the same method to take a look at organizer’s preferences on event locations and categories. In the scatted plot below, it’s not hard to discover that most organizers have their favorite parks to host events. Most organizers only host their events within 5 parks. And less than 30 of the 2168 organizers have hosted events in more than 15 parks. However, organizers can get diversified in terms of the types of event they host. We can see that many organizers have hosted up to around 17 different types of events. Also quite a few organizers have hosted between 20 to 40 different types of events. Organizers that have hosted more than 50 different types of events are: Staten Island Greenbelt Conservancy, Conference House Park, Urban Park Rangers, NYC Parks, Partnerships for Parks. The organizers that have hosted in more than 50 parks are: New York City Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, Stewardship Team, Bike New York, Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, GreenThumb, Manhattan Borough Recreation, NYC Parks: Queens Recreation, Arts, Culture &amp; Fun, City Parks Foundation, Urban Park Rangers, NYC Parks, Partnerships for Parks. We also notice that organizers who are open to more location choices are flexible with event categories as well. There is no clustering in terms of event categories for organizers that has hosted events in more than 25 parks. And the organizers with the most event locations selections (&gt;100) also have the most category selections. 5.1.3 Cost, Borough, Duration, and Time of Events In the top 10 event categories, most of them have median duration between 1 to 2 hours. Given New York’s high pace of life, it is not surprising that most events do not take a long time. The only exception is art related events, with a median duration of 6 hours. Some art events, like exhibitions, usually last longer times since the organizers would hope that more people can participate. In the meantime, art events might also take longer time for organizers to prepare the site, e.g. laying out exhibits, arranging concert stages. As for skewness, the durations for all categories are positively skewed except for art. Art events indeed have very diversified spans. There are quite a few outliers in the boxplot as well, especially for fitness and outdoor fitness events. All the fitness related events have a span of around 1.5 hours, which is reasonable since high-intensity exercises usually do not last long and short workouts cannot guarantee good outcomes. In the graph below, we put cost, duration, start time (morning: 6-12, afternoon: 12-18, evening: 18-24, night: 0-6) and borough information for NYC park events in a pairs mosaic chart. From the individual arguments, we can tell that most of the events are free; Manhatan has the most events; most events are between 1-3 hours long and event start times are mostly during the day between and more likely to be in the morning. When we look at the correlation between cost and other arguments, it appears that the ratio of non-free events are higher in Queens and Bronx compared to other boroughs. In terms of event duration, we can see that the non-free event ratio is higher for events that last more than 5 hours, which could be because that the preparation for those events cost more economically. The correlation between duration and borough shows that Manhattan has the highest ratio of events less than 1 hour and Staten Island has the highest ratio of events lasting more than 5 hours. Between borough and start time, Brooklyn has the highest ratio of evening events but lowest ratio of morning events. And Bronx has the lowest ratio of evening events. At last, it’s not surprising that most of the events last more than 5 hours starts in the morning and none of those events happen at night. Events with duration between 1-3 hours has the most evenly distributed start time range, since they would not cause inconvenience to participants and parks starting at any time during the day. However, much to our surprises, events that last less than an hour often starts earlier in the day. It’s likely that a lot of them happen early in the morning on people’s way to work. 5.2 Timeseries Analysis Now, it is natural to think that there is some seasonality in the events that happen in the NYC public locations. Here we are going to perform an analysis on what are some interesting seasonal patterns 5.2.1 Timeseries Analysis on NYC Parks Events First, we simply take an overview look at the count of listed events over time: Here, we observe a few things at first sight: The data counts appears to be abnormally low after the start of 2019, probably due to limited data availablility in the dataset, therefore, we are going to only use data prior to 2019 in our following timeseries analysis on the events daata in this section. The seasonality pattern looks similar for each year. There is definitely fewer events in winters around Janurary and generally more events in the summers. The previous plot, although helps us identify the general pattern, looks pretty noisy, so next let’s take a different view, which is less noisy: Here, we aggregate the event count by the weekdays of a month in each year from 2013 to 2018. It is very clear from these charts that the monthly counts and trends do indeed have a very similar pattern across the years 2013-2018. Other than some fluctuations, January through March are typically the more quiet months with fewer than 500 events in most years, then the number of events gradually increases in April, May and June, and peaks in July or August with more than 1500 events, and then gradually decreases into the winter season, with around 500 events in December. Now, how about different days of week? It’s certainly natural to speculate that there will be more events over weekends than during weekdays. Here, since we have concluded in the previous section that the seasonal trend is similar across the years, we take a closer look at the number of listed events by day of week in 2017 to get an idea. As expected, Saturdays do typically have a lot more events than the other days, especially during the summer season. It is somewhat surprising that Sundays only have about similar number of events as Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. We speculate that for weekends, people prefer to stay at home with family and prepare for the new week on Sundays and prefer to go out to events on Saturdays, and therefore the event organizers have a preference to organize events on Saturdays. It is not surprising that Monday have the fewest events since people are typically busy on the first business day of the week. Fridays also appear to have the 2nd fewest number of events among the different days of week, as people wrap up the work for the week, and usually have corporate events or team bonding activities on Fridays. We can also notice a change of weekly pattern of event count in each month. As expected, the winter months are quieter than spring and summer months. Also, in winter months, there is a less difference between weekdays and weekends. Same change of weekly patterns also happen when the weather is good. In July and August, parks in weekdays are almost as lively as weekends. 5.2.2 Timeseries Analysis on Event Categories After the initial timeseries analysis, we feel that it’s likely that other than the general seasonality and weekly trends, different event sub-categories could have very different trends. Thus we will take a closer look at the top 30 categories for NYC parks events in this section. First, we look at if there are trends in the numbers of events for different categories over the years. We can notice on this plot that for most of the top categories, the number of events listed in each year from 2013 to 2018 more or less just fluctuates and stays mostly flat. However, for category “Education”, there is a very noticeable increase for year 2018, and for categories “Seniors”, “Accessible”, “Film”, “Dance”, “Free Summer Movies”, there appear to be an uptrend, whereas for categories like “Games” and “Birding”, there appear to be a downtrend. Next, we look at if all categories follow the general seasonality discussed in the previous section, or there are noticeable differences in the different categories. Here, we can see that yes, for most of the top 30 categories, they mostly follow the “more events in the summer, fewer in the winter” general rule, with some other interesting observations, most noticeably: “Nature” events appear to be relatively flat from April through October, which is Spring through Autumn for NYC, then reduces during winter. “Arts &amp; Crafts”, “Poe Park Visitor Center”, “Urban Park Rangers”, and “Talks” events look to be relatively flat and just fluctuates throughout the year, with no apparent peaks. “Volunteer”, “It’s My Park” and “City Parks Foundation” events appear to have peaks in May and October. “History”, “Tours”, and “Historic House Trust Sites” events appear to increase from Januray through October, peaks at October, and then decreases in November and December. “Birding” has peaks in April and May. Lastly, we also inspect the day of week pattern of when the top 30 event categories happen. As we can see from this plot, most of the top 30 event categories again follow the general “most events on Saturdays, fewest on Mondays” rule, again with some other interesting observations, most noticeably: “Seniors” has fewest events on Sundays and most events on Tuesdays, and relatively about the same count of events for different days of the week. “Volunteer”, “It’s My Park”, “Urban Park Rangers”, and “Birding” events happen primarily over weekends, and have very few events during weekdays. “Accessible”, “Sports”, and “Games” events happen about the same number of times during different days of the week. “Film” and “Free Summer Movies” have peaks on Fridays. “City Parks Foundation” events happen more frequently during weekdays than during weekends. “Poe Park Visitor Center” events do not occur on Sundays and Mondays. 5.3 Crimes in Parks Now we take a look at the crimes in the NYC parks recorded by NYPD. 5.3.1 Crimes in Parks Overview The distribution of crime types in the different Boroughs of NYC over the years of 2014 through 2021 is actually different, especially around “Grand Larceny” and “Robbery” - for example, Manhattan has more “Grand Larceny” than “Robbery”, whereas Staten Island and Bronx both have more “Robbery” than “Grand Larceny”. 5.3.2 Crime Timeseries Analysis In the crime time series chart below, we take a look into the tendency of different types of crimes at different quarter of a year. It’s apparent that there is a strong seasonal pattern within most of the crime types. The third quarter of the year is when assaults, grand larcenies and robberies happens the most. Over the years, we notice that the number of total crimes, grand larcenies and robberies have reduced in the year of 2020 and 2021. We suspect that the pandemic caused such decrements. However, we couldn’t conclude on any patterns on burglaries, grand larcenies of motor vehicles, murders and rapes, since they don’t happen that often overall. One thing worth mentioning is that, the number of park events shows a similar pattern where they peak in Q3 each year, which indicate a possible positive correlation between number of park events and crimes. But we will take a closer look into such conjecture in the next section. 5.3.3 Crimes in parks and events in parks It is challenging to join the two datasets entirely based on the parks, as they come from two different data sources and do not share identifier keys for the parks. However, it is possible to manually select a few parks from both datasets and inspect the park names and try to match and join the data for those selected parks.

However, we discovered that somehow the crimes data do not have any records for crimes in “Central Park” (M010). Together with our interests of the most diverse parks as analyzed in the Most Diverse Park section, we will select the following parks to analyze, and use this manually created mapping as the helper table to join our data: (#tab:Crimes in parks and events in parks mapping table)Park in crime dataset to PkId in events dataset mapping to investigate PkId Park ParkName Q099 FLUSHING MEADOWS CORONA PARK Flushing Meadows Corona Park B169 CONEY ISLAND BEACH &amp; BOARDWALK Coney Island Beach M104 RANDALL’S ISLAND PARK Randall’s Island M098 WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK Washington Square Park B073 PROSPECT PARK Prospect Park M072 RIVERSIDE PARK Riverside Park M089 UNION SQUARE PARK Union Square Park X010 CROTONA PARK Crotona Park M008 BRYANT PARK Bryant Park X002 BRONX PARK Bronx Park X040 POE PARK Poe Park X209 WAVE HILL Wave Hill R006 CONFERENCE HOUSE PARK Conference House Park B431 BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK Brooklyn Bridge Park M029 FORT TRYON PARK Fort Tryon Park X092 VAN CORTLANDT PARK Van Cortlandt Park X039 PELHAM BAY PARK Pelham Bay Park X104 WILLIAMSBRIDGE OVAL Williamsbridge Oval Skate Park X045 ST. MARY’S PARK BRONX St. Mary’s Park M042 INWOOD HILL PARK Inwood Hill Park We understand the limitations of picking only the parks with most crimes or most events or most diverse, however, it is very difficult for us to include parks with fewer events or crimes and link them from the two data sources, for many reasons, some of which were outlined in previous Missing values chapter (that 20% of our event listing data are missing PkId), and the Most Diverse Park section (that the same PkId includes many sub-areas of parks, so that for smaller or less popular parks, it is super difficult for us to map the names across the two datasets we have). Nevertheless, we still wanted to derive certain features of these parks and see what are some interesting patterns we can find. For this parallel coordinates plot, we have arranged the x-axis columns to highlight interesting patterns, and the “Average Duration” (AvgDur) has been drawn twice for this reason too. From the several interesting dimensions we have derived from our events and crimes data for the 20 parks mentioned, there are a few interesting observations we can notice: Other than a few outliers parks, for the 20 parks we analyzed, a lot of them have similar sizes and have similar ratio of free events out of all events. We can again observe the “diversity” correlation (similarly observed in Most Diverse Park section) in terms of categories and organizers Out of the 20 parks analyzed, larger parks have better diversity in terms of event categories and organizers It is somewhat surprising to see that the more diverse parks actually listed fewer events There appear to be a negative association between the number of events in parks and the number of crimes in parks, as can be seen by the lines flowing in opposite directions and form “crosses” between the EvtCnt and TotCrm columns on the plot. We can similarly observe a negative association between the average duration of events (AvgDur) and the number of crimes (TotCrm), (and for both violent crime types (ViolentCrm) and property crime types (PropertyCrm)) in the 20 parks. This fact, together with observation number 5, makes us suspect that crimes more frequently happen when there are not a lot of people/events in the parks. Other than a few outliers, it appears that parks with more violent crime types tend to have more property crime types as well. Our observations number 6 and 7 are actually contrasting our discoveries in the previous Crime Timeseries Analysis section. We think that the macro-level seasonal positive correlation between number of park events and crimes can only tell us that summer tends to be the more active season, while our negative association discovered in this section might actually be a more meaningful discovery, that the “busier” or more “active” parks in terms of events actually tend to have fewer crimes. 5.4 Spatial Analysis From the Missing values chapter, we do not have missing data for Lat, Long, which certainly prompted us to perform a detailed Spatial Analysis on the events in the NYC parks. 5.4.1 Spatial Analysis of Events By Organizer From our analysis in the Organizer Preferences on Categories and Locations section, there certainly appears to be preferences of different organizers on the parks they usually organize events in. As a result, we want to take a look at the top 8 event organizers and see where they are hosting most of their events: Not surprisingly, we can see the organizer preferences on location of events very clearly: “Bryant Park Corp.” solely organizes events in midtown Manhattan near Bryant Park. “Central Park Conservancy” organizes all of its events in Central Park. “Poe Visitor Center” only has events in Poe Park. “Prospect Park Alliance” events are all in Prospect Park. “Summer on the Hudson” events happen in different parks but all along the Hudson river. Most of “Queens Botanical Garden” events are in Queens Botanical Garden but they also organize some events outside of the Queens Botanical Garden, but mostly in Queens. “NYC Parks” and “Urban Park Rangers” are the more diverse organizers out of the top 8 active organizers that they organize events in more locations throughout the whole NYC areas in all boroughs, as similarly identified in the Organizer Preferences on Categories and Locations section. We can also observe an interesting preference of “Urban Park Rangers” to have more events along waterfronts when compared to “NYC Parks”. It is certainly very tempting for us to analyze the spatial distribution of events for different event categories, however, based on our previous analysis, we feel we have too many events categories to have a clean spatial plot to analyze, also, as analyzed in the Most Diverse Park section, many parks are having more than 20 distinct categories of events, it would certainly give us lots of over-plotting, thus we refrain ourselves from doing a deep dive of the spatial distribution of different event categories here. However, there are also interesting findings in our previous analysis in the Cost, Borough, Duration, and Time of Events section, we particularly feel it is very interesting to see the distribution of the events on the map based on their start time of the day. 5.4.2 Spatial Analysis on Events Start Time of the Day Here, we have included the following spatial graph of events colored by their start time of the day, note that due to the large amount of data, we have only included events in 2018 in this plot, but it is very representative of all the years: From the spatial plot here, it is easy to see that, as also analyzed in section Cost, Borough, Duration, and Time of Events, Brooklyn certainly has a lower ratio of morning events and higher ratio of evening events when compared to the other boroughs. Manhattan has a pretty balanced diversity of morning/afternoon/evening events. Manhattan also certainly has more densely organized events. It is also interesting but not surprising to see that there are more evening events along different waterfront parks - who doesn’t enjoy the night waterfront city view? For the “inner” located parks, there are certainly more morning/afternoon events than evening events, which certainly explains why Bronx has the highest ratio of morning events and lowest ratio of evening events out of all boroughs.

You can also mouse-over the plot to see the month and exact count of events for that month for your selected event category. It’s certainly interesting to see some similar patterns as we analyzed in the Timeseries Analysis on NYC Parks Events section but in a more interactive view and for many more event categories that we were not able to include in that section. 6.2 Monthly Event Count by Most Active Organizers Please select a month: In the interactive chart above, we allow users to see the number of events hosted by different organizers in each month. By selecting the month and year in the dropdown boxes, the chart will make a transition accordingly. The organizers shown in the chart are 10 who have organized the most events in our dataset. They are sorted alphabetically on the horizontal axis to facilitate the observation of monthly transitions for each organizer. Once hovering the mouse cursor on the bar, a tooltip will appear inidicating the value of that bar. In this chart there are some interesting findings. Some parks follow a seasonal pattern where they become more active in summer months such as Bryan Park Corp. Also some organizer do not have a seasonal pattern. For example, City Parks Foundation is only significantly more active in October. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations 7.2 Future Directions", " Chapter 7 Conclusion To conclude, we have certainly found many interesting facts about public events, their categories and organizers, in NYC parks, as well as how crimes in parks potentially relate to events in the parks. One recommendation we would have is that visiting parks during their busy times (when there are events happening) might be not only exciting, but also safer. 7.1 Limitations As analyzed in our Timeseries Analysis on NYC Parks Events section, we only have complete events data from start of 2013 up to only the end of year of 2018. It’d be interesting to see how things have since changed, if any, especially during and after the pandemic. Also, quite a few variables of the events listing dataset have lots of missing data as described in the Missing values chapter and we mostly skipped the analysis of those dimensions. For example, spatial analysis based on zip codes might also have been interesting if we did not have almost 40% of data missing zip codes. Another limitation of our study is that probably due to data collection errors, typos, or name changes, we found out that there were lots of (smaller) organizers having very similar names that we suspected they are the same entities. As a result we only focused on the top active organizers in most of our deep dive analysis on specific organizers. Similarly, there are many event categories (with fewer events) that are similar that we feel we could have combined them but due to the amount of work involved to manually perform the task, we decided to skip this thought. As mentioned in the Crimes in parks and events in parks section, one more limitation we’d like to re-iterate is that it was challenging for us to relate the parks in the two different datasets (events tables and crimes tables) because they come from two distinct data sources. We opted to manually construct a mapping table to join the two datasets for 20 selected parks in that section but it would have been more ideal if we can join the two datasets entirely and analyze the association of events and crimes on the entire datasets for all the parks in NYC in some way. 7.2 Future Directions Some follow up research and study that we think would be interesting to analyze: How the events in parks relate to the population and ethnic diversity of their neighborhoods? How do traffic, visitor patterns at NYC airports / train/bus/subway stations, and national/cultural holidays impact the number of events and crimes in the NYC parks? How political events affect the events and crimes in parks? Create an interactive map to show the spatial distribution of events based on one selected event category.
