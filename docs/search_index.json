We consolidated all the files there are to analyze the missing data pattern. At the beginning, there are no missing data pattern found in the data set. However, after complementing all the quarters in the quarter column for each park, we notice that there are a small portion of the parks that do not have data for certain quarters. Since the number of those parks are minimal, we have the option to remove them from our future studies.
