The city has many interesting public places to visit - New York City has more than 1,700 parks, playgrounds, and recreation facilities across the five boroughs. With the large number of public facilities, there are almost always fun events happening in the city everyday. We’re very fascinated by the different events hosted by different organizations and cultural groups here in NYC, and would like to explore several aspects about this topic.

We consolidated all the files there are to analyze the missing data pattern. At the beginning, there are no missing data pattern found in the data set. However, after complementing all the quarters in the quarter column for each park, we notice that there are a small portion of the parks that do not have data for certain quarters. Since the number of those parks are minimal, we have the option to remove them from our future studies.
