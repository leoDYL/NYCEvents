# Introduction

As Columbia students, we live in one of the most diverse and energetic cities in the world. 
The city has many interesting public places to visit - New York City has more than 1,700 parks, playgrounds, and recreation facilities across the five boroughs. 
With the large number of public facilities, there are almost always fun events happening in the city everyday.
Weâ€™re very fascinated by the different events hosted by different organizations and cultural groups here in NYC, and would like to explore several aspects about this topic.
